# Bash

- `!!` - Last command
- `!foo` - Run most recent command starting with 'foo...' (ex. !ps, !mysqladmin)
- `!foo:p` - Print command that `!foo` would run, and add it as the latest to
  command history
- `!$` - Last 'word' of last command (`/path/to/file` in the command
  `ls -lAFh /path/to/file`, `-uroot` in `mysql -uroot`)
- `!$:p` - Print word that `!$` would substitute
- `!*` - All but first word of last command (`-lAFh /path/to/file` in the
  command `ls -lAFh /path/to/file`, `-uroot` in `mysql -uroot`)
- `!*:p` - Print words that `!*` would substitute
- `^foo^bar` - Replace `foo` in last command with `bar`, print the result, then
  run. (`mysqladmni -uroot`, run `^ni^in`, results in `mysqladmin -uroot`)
- `{a,b,c}` passes words to the command, substituting `a`, `b`, and `c`
  sequentially (`cp file{,.bk}` runs `cp file file.bk`)

    $ (string)2T - All available commands starting with (string)
    $ /2T - Entire directory structure including hidden one
    $ (dir)2T - Only Sub Dirs inside (dir) including Hidden one

    $ ~2T - All Present Users on system from \"/etc/passwd\"
    $ $2T - All Sys variables
    $ @2T - Entries from "/etc/hosts"
    $ =2T - Output like ls or dir

Run something:

    for i in a b c; do $i 'hello'; done

Do something on a bunch of files:

    for i in *.rb; do echo "$i"; done

If syntax:

    if [[ -e .ssh ]]; then echo "hi"; fi

Numerical comparison:

    i=0
    if (( i <= 1 )); then
      echo "smaller or equal"
    else
      echo "bigger"
    fi

file check flags:

    -e:  file exists
    -f:  regular file (non directory)
    -d:  directory
    -s:  non-zero file
    -x:  execute permission

Avoid duplicates in your history:

    export HISTIGNORE="&:ls:ls*:[bf]g:exit"
