# Cheatly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arthurnn/cheatly.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arthurnn/cheatly)

This is a command line toolset to handle the cheat-sheets reposity located at [sheets](https://github.com/arthurnn/cheatly/tree/master/sheets) folder.

This gem is not a fork but inspired by [defunkt/cheat](https://github.com/defunkt/cheat). However instead of using a full server to store the sheets, it uses github as central repository, making more reliable and easy to add new ones.
